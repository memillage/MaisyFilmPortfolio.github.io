        I am Maisy Millage, a recent graduate from Iowa State University with a passion for filmmaking. I have been captivated by the power of 
	storytelling from a young age. Even before understanding the technical aspects of filmmaking, I would write stories and envision 
	them as visual narratives, complete with composition and camera movements. Though the thought of creating films still seemed 
	like a far-off fantasy given the cost of producing a film.
	      <br>
	While I attended high school, technological advancements made camera equipment more affordable and enabled phone cameras to 
	capture high-definition footage. This shift caused my once-distant dream of creating quality films to become an attainable
	reality. It motivated me to immerse myself in the world of filmmaking through countless hours of YouTube videos. I absorbed 
	knowledge of filmmaking concepts, lighting techniques, camera settings, and the latest advancements in camera technology. A 
	few years later, during Covid-19, I shot a few short films for at-home competitions with my trusty iPhone. A few months later, 
	my parents gifted me a remarkable tool that elevated my filmmaking journey: the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6k. This gift 
	allowed me to translate the knowledge I acquired from hours of watching videos into tangible creations that showcased my vision 
	and storytelling abilities.
	      <br>
	When choosing a college major, I decided to pursue Computer Engineering. I saw it as a path that could equip me with valuable 
	skills applicable to filmmaking, like problem-solving, and a solid foundation in technology, especially given the increasing 
	reliance on technology like CGI in the industry. After going through school, I still hold this belief to be true.
